/**
 * DDD Configuration Export
 *
 * NOTE: As of the latest version, DDD rules (require-spec-file) are now
 * included in the base configuration by default. This export is maintained
 * for backward compatibility and is currently equivalent to the base config.
 *
 * You can use either:
 * - import config from "eslint-config-agent" (includes DDD rules)
 * - import config from "eslint-config-agent/ddd" (same as above)
